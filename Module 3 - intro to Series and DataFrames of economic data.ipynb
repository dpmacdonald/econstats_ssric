    "Welcome to the SSRIC Instructional Modules for the project, \"Teaching Statistics and Economic Data Analysis in Python with Jupyter Notebooks\", by Daniel MacDonald, Associate Professor and Chair, Economics Department, CSU San Bernardino. These were written in Summer 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the modules draw extensively on Kevin Sheppard's e-book, *Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics, and Data Analysis*, available here: https://bashtage.github.io/kevinsheppard.com/files/teaching/python/notes/python_introduction_2021.pdf. \n",

    "Rather than begin instruction in Python through the core tools of computer programming (such as conditions, loops, and functions), Sheppard begins with Python's major \"containers\", or data structures. Through practice, I have learned that this is an effective method for teaching Python to economics majors.\n",

    "1. Create data structures in Python based on economic data\n",
    "1. Summarize the statistical properties of economic data (median, mean, max, min, correlation) using Python\n",
    "1. Create and manage economic data: create new columns and rows, merge and append, and import data from .csv and .xlsx files into Python\n",
    "1. Visualize economic data using line and scatterplots\n",

    "The objectives/content of Module 3 are as follows. By the end of this module, students will be able to...\n",
